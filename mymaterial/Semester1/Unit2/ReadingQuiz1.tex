\item $y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}g t^2 + v_{i,y} t + y_i$
\item $x(t) = v_{i,x} t$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose a basketball player is on top of a 60 meter building.  There is a basketball net located 10 meters horizontally from the edge of the building, and the net is 3 meters tall.  The person shoots the basketball from a height of 1.5 meters above their feet, and they shoot horizontally.  With what horizontal velocity should they shoot in order to make the shot?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Hint: draw a diagram.}
\item \textit{Hint: think of motions in x and y separately.}
\end{itemize}
