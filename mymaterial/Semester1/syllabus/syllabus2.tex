\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The concepts of algebra-based mechanics will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  First, the concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration in one and two dimensions will be introduced, building up to Newton's Laws of motion.  Next, the concepts of friction and rotational motion will be added.  More complex problems will be introduced through the conservation of energy and linear momentum, followed by the rotational equivalents.  The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, and lab-based activities.

\textit{\textbf{Pre-requisites}: None.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Course credits, Liberal Arts Categorization}: 4 Credits, None} \\
\textit{\textbf{Regular course hours}: Tuesday and Thursday from 8:50 - 10:50 in SLC 232} \\
\textit{\textbf{Instructor contact information}: jhanson2@whittier.edu, tel. 562.907.5130} \\
\textit{\textbf{Office hours}: Mondays from 1-5pm in SLC 212} \\
\textit{\textbf{Attendance/Absence}: Students needing to reschedule midterms and exams should notify the professor a reasonable time beforehand.  Students are allowed up to three absences with no penalty.  Each additional absence will result in a 10\% reduction in the in-class participation grade.  Arriving more than 10 minutes late to class will count as an absence for grading purposes. (see \textit{\textbf{Grading}}}). \\
\textit{\textbf{Late work policy}: Late work will not be accepted.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Technology policy}: The use of mobile, tablet, or laptop devices during class is not allowed, with the exception of note-taking.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Text}: College Physics (openstax.org) -  https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be three tests, each examining conceptual understanding in step-by-step problems.  Each midterm is worth 15\% of the final grade.  The weekly online homework is worth 20\% of the grade.  Interactive in-class activities will be worth 10\% of the final grade.  Lab groups will present results of a group project worth 10\% of the grade.  The final exam will be held on December 13th during normal class period, and will be worth 15\% of the grade.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grade Settings}: $<60\%$ = F, $>60\%,\leq 70\%$ = D, $>70\%,\leq80\%$ = C, $>80\%,\leq 90\%$ = B, $<90\%,\leq 100\%$ = A.  Pluses and minuses: 0-3\% minus, 3\%-6\% straight, 6\%-10\% plus (e.g. 79\% = C+, 91\% = A-)} \\
\textit{\textbf{Homework sets}: Typically 10 online problems per week, assigned via the ExpertTA system on Fridays, due the following Fridays.  Follow this link to register for the online homework software: \url{http://goeta.link/USB06CA-77B04F-1PD}} \\
\textit{\textbf{Just in Time Teaching}: Just in Time Teaching (JITT) are assignments beginning the second week of class based on course reading.  The day before class, students will receive conceptual physics questions based on the reading.  Based on the response rate and accuracy, the JITT exercise will be used to tailor the lecture and discussions the following day.  Answering the JITT questions are part of the in-class participation grade.} \\
\textit{\textbf{ADA Statement on Disability Services}: Whittier College is committed to make learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you experience physical or academic barriers due to a disability, you are encouraged to contact Student Disability Services (SDS) to discuss options. To learn more about academic accommodations, email disabilityservices@whittier.edu, call (562) 907-4825, or go to SDS which is located on the ground floor of Wardman Library.} \\
