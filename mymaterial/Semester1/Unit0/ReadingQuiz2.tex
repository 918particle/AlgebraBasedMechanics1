\section{Chapter 2 - Kinematics}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it possible for velocity to be constant while acceleration is not zero? Explain. \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item Give an example in which velocity is zero yet acceleration is not. \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item If a subway train is moving to the left (has a negative velocity) and then comes to a stop, what is the direction of its
acceleration? Is the acceleration positive or negative?  Draw a diagram, just giving example vectors of the velocity and acceleration.
\end{enumerate}
