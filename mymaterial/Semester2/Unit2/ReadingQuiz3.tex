\author{Prof. Jordan C. Hanson}

\maketitle

\section{Memory Bank}

\begin{itemize}
\item $V = i R$ ... Ohm's Law, with $V$ for voltage, $i$ for current, and $R$ for resistance.
\item $R_{tot} = R_1 + R_2$ ... Total resistance of two resistors in series.
\item $R_{tot}^{-1} = R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1}$ ... Total resistance of two resistors in parallel.
\end{itemize}

\section{Current from Resistance and Voltage}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose an electrical circuit is comprised of a 5V battery, and two 1k$\Omega$ resistors \textit{in series}.  What is the current flowing from the battery? \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item Suppose an electrical circuit is comprised of a 5V battery, and two 1k$\Omega$ resistors \textit{in parallel}.  What is the current flowing from the battery? \\ \vspace{3cm}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Power}

Suppose the power consumed by the circuit is $P = i V$, where $i$ is the current and $V$ is the voltage.  Compute the power consumption for the circuits above.
