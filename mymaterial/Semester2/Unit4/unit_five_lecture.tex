\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=black!40!black,title=Faraday's Law]
\alert{The emf $\epsilon$ induced is the negative change in the magnetic flux $\Phi_m$ per unit time. Any change in the magnetic field
or change in orientation of the area of the coil with respect to the magnetic field induces a voltage (emf).
\begin{align}
\phi_m &= \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} \\
\epsilon &= - \frac{\Delta\phi_m}{\Delta t}
\label{eq:farad}
\end{align}}

\textbf{Example:}
A square coil has sides 0.25 m long and is tightly wound with 200 turns of wire. The resistance of the coil 5.0 Ohms. The coil is placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field that is directed perpendicular to the face of the coil and whose magnitude is decreasing by âˆ’0.040 T/s. (a) What is the magnitude of the emf induced in the coil? (b) What is the magnitude of the current circulating through the coil?

\textbf{Example:}
A magnetic field B is directed outward perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of radius r = 0.50 m.  The field is cylindrically symmetrical with respect to the center of the coil, and its magnitude decreases linearly according to
\begin{equation}
B(t) = B_0 - a t
\end{equation}
with $B_0 = 1.5$ T and $a = 5.0$ T s$^{-1}$.  (a) Calculate the emf induced in the coil at the times $t_0 = 0$, $t_1 = 0.05$, and $t_2 = 1.0$ seconds. (b) Determine the current in the coil if the resistance is 10 Ohms.

\section{Faraday's Law: An application}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law: An application}
Start with Faraday's Law:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = - \frac{\Delta \phi_B}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
The flux $\phi_B$ is changing and depends on time:
\begin{equation}
\phi_B = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}(t) = BA\cos(\theta(t))
\end{equation}
Let the \textit{angular velocity} be constant: $\theta = \omega t$.  Then we have
\begin{equation}
\phi_B  = BA\cos(\omega t)
\end{equation}
Thus the emf (with $N$ loops) is (...calculus...)
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = N\omega BA \sin(\omega t) = \epsilon_0 \sin(\omega t)
\end{equation}
\textbf{The generation of AC power stems from $\omega$.} \\ (Professor: diagram of $\epsilon(t)$).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law: An application}
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = N\omega BA \sin(\omega t)
\end{equation}
The AC voltage equation above is a basic model for the voltage from a generator.  Which of the following would increase the \textit{amplitude} of the emf?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: Turning the area more slowly.
\item B: Turning the area more quickly.
\item C: Increasing the B-field.
\item D: Both B and C.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law: An application}

\end{equation}
The AC voltage equation above is a basic model for the voltage from a generator.  Which of the following would increase the \textit{frequency} of the emf?

\item B: Turning the area more quickly.
\item C: Increasing the B-field.
\item D: Both B and C.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{equation}
\textbf{Group exercise:} Suppose an AC generator rotates at 200 rpm, in a B-field with 0.1 T, and has 100 loops with radius 5 cm.  (a) What is the peak voltage this generator will produce? (b) If the generator powers a system with resistance of 1k$\Omega$, what will be the peak current?

At left is a water source that falls under gravity, turning a wheel.  Set the water rate with the slider at the top left.  Slide it until the meter reads 10 rotations per minute.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Under the pickup coil menu, choose the voltage meter.
\item Under loops, choose 1 loop, and under area, leave it at 50\%.  Leave the strength of the bar magnet as is.
\item Choose show field meter in the upper right, and place the measurement tool in the center of the loops.
\item Draw a graph of the average B-field versus time.
\item Underneath the graph of B-field versus time, draw a graph of the voltage versus time in the pickup coil.
\item Change the number of loops to 3, and add a new B-field curve to the original B-field vs. time plot, and add a new curve to the original voltage versus time plot.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PhET: AC Power generator}

\textbf{Now double the water rate to 20 rpm, and create a new set of graphs:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Under loops, choose 1 loop, and under area, leave it at 50\%.  Leave the strength of the bar magnet as is.
\item Draw a graph of the average B-field versus time.
\item Underneath the graph of B-field versus time, draw a graph of the voltage versus time in the pickup coil.
\item Change the number of loops to 3, and add a new B-field curve to the original B-field vs. time plot, and add a new curve to the original voltage versus time plot.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Which of your graphs should be the same as the 10 rpm case, and which should be different?}
