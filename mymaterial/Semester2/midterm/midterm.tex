\section{Electric Charge and Electric Fields}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Scaling problem}: (a) Some point charge produces an E-field $E_{\rm C} = 2.00 \times 10^{-3}$ V/m at a distance of 1 mm. What is the value of $E_{\rm C}$ at 5 mm produced by the same charge? (b) A 1 $\mu$C charge produces an E-field $E_{\rm C} = 8.00 \times 10^{-3}$ V/m at some distance.  What is the value of $E_{\rm C}$ at the same distance if the charge is 3 $\mu$C? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\end{figure}
The classic Millikan oil drop experiment was the first to measure the electron charge. Oil drops were suspended against the gravitational force by an electric field. (See Fig. \ref{fig:mill}.) Suppose the drops have a \textit{mass} of $4\times 10^{-16}$ kg, and the E-field is oriented downward, and has a value of 6131.25 N/C.  With this exact value, the drops remain suspended in air.  (a)  How many electrons are on the drops?  (b) Suppose a cosmic ray comes along and removes an electron from a droplet.  What will the acceleration of the droplet be? \\ \vspace{3cm}

\section{Potential Energy and Voltage, Capacitors}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A \textit{mass spectrometer} is a device used to accelerate ions to determine atomic masses of chemicals.  Suppose two conducting plates with potential difference $\Delta V = 4$ kV are used to accelerate both hydrogen ions and helium ions.  Hydrogens have charge $+1 q_e$, and helium ions have charge $+2 q_e$.  (a) What is the total kinetic energy (in electron-volts) gained by the hydrogens and heliums? (b) If the plate separation is $\Delta x = 5$ cm, what is the electric field value?  \textit{Hint: think of the E-field as the slope of voltage.} \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item Suppose a parallel plate capacitor has an internal E-field of 1 kV/m, and a plate separation of 2 mm.  Draw the voltage as a function of distance between the negative and the positive plates.  Make sure to label the axes with proper units, and mark the x-value of each plate.  What is the y-intercept of this function? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item Suppose the plates in the previous problem have an area of 1 cm$^2$.  (a) What is the capacitance of the system? (b) How much energy (in Joules) is stored in this capacitor if the voltage is 5 V?
\item Suppose we need a system that can store more energy for the same voltage (in other words, more capacitance).  Should we connect an identical capacitor to the first \textit{in series} or \textit{in parallel}?  \\ \vspace{1cm}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Current, Resistance, and DC Circuits}

\begin{enumerate}

\item When dealing with AA batteries, we can either connect them ``end to end'' (in series), or in parallel (see Fig. \ref{fig:ohm1}).  Suppose that the internal resistances of the batteries $r_1 = r_2 = 2 \Omega$, and that the emfs of the two batteries are both $\epsilon_1 = \epsilon_2 = 1.5$ V.  Finally, let $R = 50 \Omega$.  Suppose $R$ represents a small device that will work at 1.5 V or 3 V (a child's toy, an old CD player, a computer mouse).  (a) Using Kirchhoff's rules, find the current through $R$ for the serial case (3 V) (Fig. \ref{fig:ohm1}, left), and the parallel case (Fig. \ref{fig:ohm1}, right).  (b) What is the power consumption in each case?  (c) Check your calculations of current using the PhET DC circuit construction modeling kit.

\item Recall the PhET activity in which we covered nerve stimulation as chemical-driven capacitors.  Think of the voltage as a signal versus time that flows down the nerve.  If you stimulate the nerve in this calculation, (a) what is the pulse width, in milliseconds?  (b) What is the peak-to-peak voltage (greatest voltage minus least) in millivolts?
