\section{Equations and constants}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Kirchhoff's Rules: 1) $I_{in} + I_{out} = 0$ (Junction Rule) 2) $\sum_{loop} V_i = 0$ (Loop Rule)
\item Ohm's Law: $V = IR$
\item Power from current: $P=IV$
\item Voltage in an RC across the capacitor: $V(t) = \epsilon\left(1 - \exp\left(-t/\tau\right)\right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the battery voltage and $\tau = RC$.
\item Centripetal force: $F_C = mv^2/r$.
\item Magnetic torque: $\vec{\tau}_B = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$
\item Magnitude of torque: $|\vec{\tau}_B| = \mu B \sin\theta$
\item Magnetic dipole moment: $\vec{\mu} = I \vec{A}$ (the current times the area vector)
\item Magnetic field at the center of a current-carrying loop: $\vec{B} = (\mu_0 I)/(2 R)\hat{z}$, if the current is in the x-y plane.
\item Magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire at a distance R: $B = (\mu_0 I)/(2 \pi R)$, right-hand rule gives direction.
\item Ampere's Law: $\int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_0 I_{enc}$ which is $B S = \mu_0 I_{enc}$ for simple cases where B is constant around the path.
\item Magnetic permeability: $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T m A$^{-1}$
\item The Hall Effect: $V_H = B l v$.

Solve algebraiclly for the five currents in Fig. \ref{fig:circuit2}.  Remember to use the \textit{junction rule} and the \textit{loop rule.} \\ Here we list the possible loop rule equations and junction rule equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Loop 1: $V_1 = I_2 R_2 + I_1 R_1$
\item Loop 2: $V_2 = I_3 R_3 + I_2 R_2 - I_4 R_4$
\item Loop 3: $V_2 = I_5 R_5$
\item Junction 1: $I_1 + I_3 = I_2$
\item Junction 2: $I_2 + I_5 = I_4$

\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{cyclo.png}
\caption{\label{fig:cyclo} Each diagram depicts the force on a negatively-charged particle in a B-field.}
\end{figure}
(a) Show that the period $T$ of the circular orbit of a charged particle with mass $m$ and charge $q$ moving perpendicularly to a uniform magnetic field is $T = 2\pi m/(qB)$. (b) What is the frequency $f$? (c) What is the angular velocity $\omega$?  (c) A cyclotron accelerates charged particles as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cyclo}. Calculate the frequency of the accelerating voltage needed for a proton in a 0.9 T B-field. \\ \\
Set the centripetal force equal to the magnetic Lorentz force:
\begin{align}
qvB &= \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
qB &= \frac{mv}{r} \\
v &= \frac{2\pi r}{T} \\
T &= \frac{2\pi m}{qB}
\end{align}
The frequency is the inverse of the period:
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
\end{equation}
The angular velocity is always $\omega = 2\pi f$:
\begin{equation}
\omega = \left(\frac{q}{m}\right) B
\end{equation}
A proton would need
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19} C \times 0.9 T}{2\pi \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} kg} \approx 13.7 MHz
\end{equation}
So about 13.7 MHz.
