\begin{itemize}
\item Permittivity of free space: $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^
{-12}$ F/m 
\item Permeability of free space: $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T A$^{-1}$ m
\item The \textit{inductance} $L$ of a system that induces an emf $\epsilon$ given a change in current $\Delta I/\Delta t$ is
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = -L \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
\item The energy stored in a capacitor with capacitance $C$ and voltage $V$ is
\begin{equation}
U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2
\end{equation}
\item The energy stored in an inductor with inductance $L$ and current $I$ is
\begin{equation}
U = \frac{1}{2}L I^2
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{There is only one form of energy ...}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How much energy is stored in a capacitor with $C = 1 \mu$F, at a voltage of 12 V? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item How much energy is stored in an inductor with $L = 1 \mu$H (micro-Henries), at a current of 2 A? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item What voltage is induced in an inductor with $L = 1 \mu$H (micro-Henries), if the current changes at a rate of 0.1 A/s? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Recall that the formula for capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is $C = \epsilon_0 A/d$, where $A$ is the plate area, $d$ is the separation between the plates, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.  What is the capacitance of a capacitor with area $A = 1$ cm$^2$ and plate separation 1 mm?
