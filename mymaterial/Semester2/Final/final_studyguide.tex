\end{itemize}
\item Draw a graph of the voltage versus separation for the capacitor in the previous problem.  Label which side of the graph corresponds to positive charge and which side corresponds to negative charge.  Label the axes with approprate units. \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item Recall that the definition of capacitance is $Q = CV$, for a charge $Q$ and voltage $V$.  How much charge is stored on the capacitor in the previous two problems ($V = 12$ V), if the capacitance is $1 \mu$F? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is $C = \epsilon_0 A/d$, where $A$ is the area of the plates, $d$ is the separation between the plates, and $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ N$^{-1}$ C$^2$ m$^{-2}$.  What is the capacitance of a capacitor with an area of 4 mm$^2$ and a separation of 1 mm? \\ \vspace{2cm}

\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Electric current, resistance, and Ohm's law}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Recall that Ohm's law states that $V = iR$, and that resistors in series add, while resistors in parallel add in reciprocal.  Find the total current from the battery in the circuit drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:circuit}.

\item \textbf{Magnetism}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The toroidal magnetic field in the tokamak fusion reactor in Fig. \ref{fig:tok} is created by the external current.  The plasma is hot ionized gas, and the \textit{poloidal} magnetic field is created by it.  In which direction is the plasma flowing, and which law of physics creates the poloidal field as a result?

\item \textbf{Electromagnetic waves}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Recall that $c = f\lambda$.  Using the speed of light ($c = 3.0 \times 10^8$ m/s), convert each of the following frequencies to their corresponding wavelengths:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10 MHz
\item 100 MHz
\item 1 GHz
\end{itemize}
\item Recall that $c = f\lambda$ is modified to $c/n = f\lambda$ when an electromagnetic wave is traveling in a dielectric material, where $n$ is the index of refraction.  Suppose we record a radio wave traveling through a block of a substance that is 10 m long, and the wave travels for 67 ns from the start to the end of the block.  What is the index of refraction $n$? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item If the frequency is 1 GHz, what is the wavelength \textit{while the wave is inside the material}? (It's not the value for air).
