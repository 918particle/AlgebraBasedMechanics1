\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The concepts of algebra-based mechanics will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  First, the concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration in one and two dimensions will be introduced, building up to Newton's Laws of motion.  Next, the concepts of friction and rotational motion will be added.  More complex problems will be introduced through the conservation of energy and linear momentum, followed by the rotational equivalents.  The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, and lab-based activities.

\textit{\textbf{Regular course hours}: Monday and Wednesday from 8:50 - 10:50 in SLC 228} \\
\textit{\textbf{Office hours}: Tuesdays at 12:50 and Wednesdays at 15:00 in SLC 212} \\
\textit{\textbf{Text}: College Physics (openstax.org) -  https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be four 45-minute midterms, each examining conceptual understanding in step-by-step problems.  Each midterm is worth 12.5\% of the final grade.  The ExpertTA system (\$30.00 online) will manage the homework sets, which are due weekly and worth 20\% of the grade.  Interactive in-class activities will be worth 15\% of the final grade.  The final exam will be held on December 13th for a hald-class period, and will be worth 15\% of the grade.}
