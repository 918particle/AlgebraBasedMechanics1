\begin{enumerate}
\item $v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ ... Average velocity.
\item $x(t) = v t + x_i$ ... Position versus time with constant velocity.
\item $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ ... Acceleration is the change in velocity.
\item $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \Delta x$ ... Kinematic equation without time.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Graphical Analysis of Kinematics}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the motion of the runner depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:1}.  (a) What is the speed of the system after $t = 4$ seconds? (b) What is the acceleration between $t=0$ and $t=4$ seconds? (c) What is the speed of the runner between $t=0$ and $t=4$ seconds? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Now change the y-axis units in Fig. \ref{fig:1} to velocity, in meters per second.  Answer parts (a)-(c) from the previous question again.  For part (c), write your answer as a function of time. \\ \vspace{4cm}
