\section{How to Submit this Worksheet}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download this PDF to your device.
\item Complete the procedure below.
\item Scan your document into a PDF using a Smartphone app, or simply a photo.  One example app is SimpleScanner.  Websites also exist to convert jpg to PDF format (e.g. \url{https://smallpdf.com/jpg-to-pdf}).
\item Upload your worksheet PDF to Moodle via the submission link.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Procedure}

Repeat the PhET/spreadsheet analysis performed in the tutorial videos on Moodle: \textit{Asynchronous Lessons 3, 4, and 5.}  The goal is to show that 

\begin{equation}
U = \frac{1}{2}C V^2
\end{equation}

That is, the energy should be directly proportional to capacitance, and proportional to the square of voltage.  You should create two graphs.  One that shows the linear relationship of U and C, and one that shows the quadratic relationship of U and V.  However, for the second one, it is probably easier to plot U vs. V$^2$.
