\begin{abstract}
The concepts of algebra-based electricity, magnetism, and modern physics will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  The course will begin with the concepts of electric charge, electrostatics, and electric potential.  Following electrostatics, applications to DC circuits will be covered.  Next, the topics of magnetism and electromagnetism will be covered, concluding with light and optics.  Time-permitting, selected topics in modern physics will be added.  The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, group-designed projects, and lab-based activities.

\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be three tests, each examining conceptual understanding in step-by-step problems. Each midterm is worth 15\% of the final grade. The weekly online homework is worth 20\% of the grade. Interactive in-class activities will be worth 10\% of the final grade. Lab groups will present results of a group project worth 10\% of the grade. The final exam will be held on May 11th, 8:00-10:00 am, and will be worth 15\% of the grade.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grade Settings}: $<60\%$ = F, $\geq 60\%, <70\%$ = D, $\geq 70\%, <80\%$ = C, $\geq 80\%, <90\%$ = B, $\geq 90\%, <100\%$ = A.  Pluses and minuses: 0-3\% minus, 3\%-6\% straight, 6\%-10\% plus (e.g. 79\% = C+, 91\% = A-)} \\
\textit{\textbf{Homework Sets}: Typically 5-10 problems per week, assigned and collected on Tuesdays.  See \url{http://goeta.link/USB06CA-FF35D5-1ZU} for online homework setup.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Bonus Essay}: Students may submit an essay on the history of scientific developments covered in the course, due at the end of the semester. The essay must be 10 pages, address scientific arguments and results, and must include references. The grade of this paper will replace the lowest midterm grade. Students wishing to submit must notify the professor no later than one week after the second midterm.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Thursday science presentations.} Optionally, students may present a recent scientific article or publication to the class on Thursdays for a bonus point on the most recent homework or midterm. Limit one point per student per Thursday.} \\
\textit{\textbf{ADA Statement on Disability Services}: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.
